# Lab 05 instructions

## Objective

Make the student understand how to analyze a valid CFG

# Requirements

* Linux machine, either a VM or a bare metal host
* git send mail server installed and configured on your Linux machine

## Instructions


A grammar is reduced if each of its nonterminals and productions participates
in the derivation of some string in the grammar’s language. Nonterminals that
can be safely removed are called useless.

```
S → A | B 
A → a 
B → B b
C → c

```
	  
The above grammar contains two kinds of nonterminals that cannot participate in any derived string:

• With S as the start symbol, the nonterminal C cannot appear in any phrase.
• Any phrase that mentions B cannot be rewritten using the grammar’s rules to contain only terminals.

Referring to Section 4.2.1 of the book: Crafting a Compiler 2nd edition

	* Devise an algorithm to detect nonterminals that cannot be reached from a CFG’s goal symbol.
	* Devise an algorithm to detect nonterminals that cannot derive any terminal string in a CFG.

The code could be in any of the following lenguages:

* C ( recomended )
* C++
* python
* Java

```
make
./gramar_analyser <FILE>

```
